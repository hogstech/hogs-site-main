			<h1>Who Are We<span>.</span></h1>
			<hr />
			<p>
				The House of General Science is a venerated social, academic, and professional organization dedicated to fostering its member’s love of science and science ­related fields. We have people from a wide variety of majors, not just the hard sciences and accept people from all majors. Some of the many subjects that our members study
				include engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, computer science, and graphic design. However, all of our members have one thing in common: a love of science, and that is what brings us all together. If you would like to talk to members and get to know more about the house, reach out to us on our social media or at hogspresident@gmail.com

				<h3>Social</h3>
				<p>
					The social committee organizes a wide array of social events of various sizes. Our events encompass everything from sports such as basketball, to relaxing activities such as movie nights and game nights. Our community interacts with other Special Interest Houses through events including potlucks, trips to Lasertron (a local laser-tag facility), and other inter-SIH events on campus. Some of our larger events include: an annual apple-picking trip, an annual trip to Letchworth State Park, and War Pigs, of course, a game created by HoGS modeled after capture the flag. The social committee maintains an active environment in our community and gives members opportunities to hang out on a variety of scales.

Additionally, members will often provide their own appliances, such as tea kettles, to be used by the rest of the floor or host food nights in the lounge. HoGS Experimental Learning Lounge (H.E.L.L.) is equipped with a variety of tools available for all members to use in both academic and personal projects. There are numerous resources like tools and project materials along with a 3-D printer for members to use. T-Lounge is equipped with a whiteboard, tables and couches for members and their friends to work together on projects. T-Lounge is also home to our textbook library, which includes both reference books and textbooks that can be borrowed for whole semesters. This library grows in size and variety every year. Additionally, we have a storage closet on floor which holds projects, board games, additional nerf blasters, and other floor resources for ease of access.

				<h3>Projects</h3>
				<p>
					The House of General Science has a long history of developing interesting and innovative projects to sate our desire to learn and create. We have a wide range of projects including a radio telescope, a high voltage electrical harmonic system, a Larger than Life Piano, and many others. One of the biggest events of the year for HoGS is Imagine RIT, and we develop projects throughout the semester to display during the festival. We regularly bring numerous projects to the festival and work with the College of Science to provide funds for our members' projects. In addition, we attend events like the Rochester Maker Faire and the Brick City Science Fair throughout the year to display projects. We welcome project ideas from any field and are always excited to help develop them!

				<h3>Community Service</h3>
				<p>
					The House of General Science is more than just a special interest house, it is a community. We fundraise for important causes as an entire floor, and we have a ton of fun doing it. Every year our annual livestream for ExtraLife raises thousands of dollars for Golisano Children's Hospital. We participate as a team in the annual Mud-Tug event, where the proceeds are all donated to charity. Additionally, we have community service events throughout the semester to encourage members to give back to the community and help good causes. All of these events are designed to give back to the community, while bonding as a Special Interest House.

						"HoGS is a great way of meeting people with all different majors, backgrounds, and interests, while still having something in common: a love of the floor. I find it to be unique among clubs and SIHs at RIT that the members are not exclusively scientists or engineers or programmers, and this variety makes the experiences and
						bonds that are shared between the members only better."

						"When I first entered college, the prospects of living in an unfamiliar setting with unfamiliar people terrified me.Being in HoGS, however, helped tremendously.  There's a bunch of different majors here, yet we all share a common interest: science.  This dichotomy between divergent backgrounds and common nerdiness
						enriches the floor and brings people together in ways not often seen."

						"I hear some people talk that their floor is generally quiet and calm with nothing going on. Here on HoGS, that's non-existent: there's someone doing something fun or interesting that everyone else can join in on almost every day. HoGS is probably the best decision I made regarding housing, and I am grateful."

						"Special Interest Housing is a very unique concept that you will not find at any other college. The House of General Science (HoGS) allows me to be surrounded by a bunch of nerds who are passionate about what they do, support me in what I do, and let me call them family. Joining HoGS has been the best decision I have ever made
						at college both socially and academically."

						"HoGS is like a dysfunctional, yet still functional family. We all come from different backgrounds, but when we are on floor, we are a big, happy, nerdy, family. If you ask someone for help with homework or even laundry, they are more than willing to help. In addition, most upperclassmen have taken the classes you have, so they
						can help. There are an infinite number of fantastic things to say about the House of General Science. It's the best part of my college experience."

						"From the moment I set foot on floor, this place has been my home away from home. It was so easy to make friends and I quickly became close to everyone. One of the huge benefits to being on floor is how easy it is to form study groups or find upperclassmen who have taken similar classes. (I have helped so many people with physics!)
						I could go on and on, but essentially, HoGS is a place where you can have crazy adventures, meet amazing people, be intellectually challenged, and excel academically."

						"I love how HoGS is more than just a floor of nerds with a love of science. We are more than students working towards a BS or BFA. Some of us are musicians, some of us are artists. Some of us are fantastic at videogames or board games; amazing at knitting or crocheting. We are more than just talented individuals. We are a large
						group of friends, a community of people you can turn to, a family. HoGS has given me a chance. It has taught me to love myself and embrace my quirks."

						"When I came to RIT, to HoGS, I was immediately accepted. There was no question or doubt in my mind that I could relate with every single person on and off this floor as soon as I met them. The great thing about HoGS, in my mind, is the sense of community. If someone is having a hard time with anything, stress, parents, relationships,
						homework, or anything else you need not go farther than a walk down the hall to receive the comfort or help you need. Although, many of us still butt heads every once in a while, we still choose to help one another. We are a family."

						"HoGS has been a completely life-changing experience for me. From having almost-daily family dinners to sitting up late at night to cram for exams, the community I have experienced through HoGS has defined my experience in college. I've never experienced a place that feels so immediately accepting and welcoming, you walk on floor and several people immediately say hello and check in. It doesn't matter what is happening, HoGS feels like a community."
